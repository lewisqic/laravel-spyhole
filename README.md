Laravel Spyhole is a user session recorder for the Laravel Framework. Laravel Spyhole is a wrapper for the JS Library [RRWeb](https://www.rrweb.io/) (Record and replay the web). It allows a simple way to embed the Recorder into your views and start recordings out-of-the-box.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require lewisqic/laravel-spyhole
```

## Usage

After installation publish the config file:

``` php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lewisqic\LaravelSpyhole\LaravelSpyholeServiceProvider"
```

In the configuration file you can set:

* **Session ID tracking**: this will make the package track the session ID from the Laravel built-in Session, if set to false, a random UUID will be generated for the user session.
* **User ID tracking**: this will make the package track the user ID with recordings.
* **Minimum sampling rate**: the minimum number of records to be recorded from frontend before sending. (Default: 50)

Finally, to start recording, just embed the recorder view to the view you want to record.

```php
@include("laravel-spyhole::embed_spyhole")
```

### How it works in short

As pointed before, spyhole uses RRWeb as its internal recorder.

In the `resources/assets` folder there are the published assets where you can find the RRWeb files and the built version of `recording-handler.js`, a JS script handling the RRWeb initialization and recording sendings.  

The recordings are posted to a route named `spyhole.store-entry` (whose URL is `/spyhole-api/record`). Recordings are accessible via the model `Lewisqic\LaravelSpyhole\Models\SessionRecording` with properties: ID, path, recordings (an array stored gzipped and base 64 encoded) and user ID.

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
